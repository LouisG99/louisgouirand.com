Dear Monzo Representative, 

My name is Louis Gouirand. Thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Backend Engineer intern role at your company. I carry a strong interest in your company and the exciting work it does, especially in the Financial and Security sector. As a student at the University of Michigan College, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Engineering in Computer Science and plan to graduate in April 2021. I believe my interest, experience as well as my versatility would make me a strong fit for the role. 

My past experiences and current skills in Computer Science applications would enable me to pick up quickly on the work of a Backend Engineer at your company. I have experience with object-oriented programming languages including Python and C++. After self-learning the basics of Python, I worked on several mathematical implementation codes while aiming for efficiency in them. Furthermore, I have developed applications of C++ by creating a computer-based version of a card game as well as an automated player against which the user can play. Finally, as a member of a Hyperloop engineering student team, I applied those skills on big-scale projects while learning to cooperate with people from broad technical skills and interests.

Beyond technical skills, being of French and Brazilian origin while also studying in the United States has given me a global perspective as well as strong communication skills in two languages. As a French tutor for other Michigan college students, I have had to express myself in clear and concise ways going back and forth from English to French. In parallel, I have explored other interests of mine by taking in several business competitions, fostering my creativity and ability to pick up new skills. 

I believe my unique perspective, interests and set of qualifications would align with the position as well as the company spirit. I appreciate your time and consideration, and I look forward to being in touch with you. 


Best regards, 

Louis Gouirand
